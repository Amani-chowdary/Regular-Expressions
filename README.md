# Regular-Expressions
ðŸ§¾ Input Validation using Regular Expressions (Python)
This project is a simple Python script that demonstrates the use of regular expressions (regex) for validating and formatting user inputs through the command line. Itâ€™s an excellent example for beginners who are learning how to use regex for real-world data validation.

ðŸš€ Features
Name Validation: Accepts only alphabetic characters and spaces, preventing invalid name entries.

Date of Birth Validation: Ensures the format is strictly dd-mm-yyyy, and converts it into a readable dd-mon-yyyy format.

Email Validation: Accepts lowercase Gmail addresses (e.g., example@gmail.com) using regex pattern matching.

Mobile Number Validation: Requires the format xxx-xxx-xxxx and converts it into a continuous 10-digit string.

Modular Input Collection: Utilizes reusable functions to reduce repetition and improve code readability.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Python 3

re module (Regular Expressions)

ðŸ“Œ Use Case
This script can be used in:

Form validation for CLI-based applications

Learning purposes for understanding regex in Python

Preprocessing data entries before storing or using them in larger systems
